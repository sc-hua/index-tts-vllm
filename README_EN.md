# IndexTTS-vLLM
</div>

## Recent Updates
- **[Fix]** Fixed vLLM version compatibility issues, now supporting the latest version.
- **[Fix]** Optimized `WeTextProcessing` (tn) loading logic and added fault tolerance.
- **[Feat]** Added `safe_torchaudio_load` to replace `torchaudio.load`, improving audio loading stability.
- **[Feat]** Supported BigVGAN compilation on CUDA sm_110 architecture.
- **[Feat]** Optimized resource cleanup (NCCL/vLLM) and model shutdown logic.

## Introduction
This project re-implements the GPT model's inference from [index-tts](https://github.com/index-tts/index-tts) using the vllm library, accelerating the inference process of index-tts.

Inference speed improvement (Index-TTS-v1/v1.5) on a single RTX 4090:
- RTF (Real-Time Factor) for a single request: ≈0.3 -> ≈0.1
- GPT model decode speed for a single request: ≈90 tokens/s -> ≈280 tokens/s
- Concurrency: With `gpu_memory_utilization` set to 0.25 (approx. 5GB VRAM), it can handle a concurrency of around 16 without pressure (refer to `simple_test.py` for the benchmark script).

## Update Log

- **[2025-09-22]** Added support for vllm v1. Compatibility with IndexTTS2 is in progress.

- **[2025-09-28]** Supported web UI inference for IndexTTS2 and organized the weight files for easier deployment! \0.0/ ; However, the current version doesn't seem to accelerate the GPT of IndexTTS2, which is under investigation.

- **[2025-09-29]** Resolved the issue of ineffective GPT model inference acceleration for IndexTTS2.

- **[2025-10-09]** Compatible with IndexTTS2 API calls, please refer to [API](#api); APIs for v1/1.5 and the OpenAI-compatible interfaces may still have bugs, to be fixed later.

- **[2025-10-19]** Supported vllm inference for qwen0.6bemo4-merge.

## TODO list
- Concurrency optimization for V2 API: Currently, only the gpt2 model inference is parallel, while other modules run serially. The s2mel inference has a large overhead (requiring 25 DiT iterations), which significantly impacts concurrency performance.

- Acceleration of s2mel inference.

## Usage Steps

### 1. Clone this project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ksuriuri/index-tts-vllm.git
cd index-tts-vllm
```


### 2. Create and activate a conda environment
```bash
conda create -n index-tts-vllm python=3.12
conda activate index-tts-vllm
```


### 3. Install PyTorch

PyTorch version 2.8.0 is required (corresponding to vllm 0.10.2). For specific installation instructions, please refer to the [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).


### 4. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 5. Download model weights

#### Automatic Download (Recommended)

Download the corresponding version of the model weights to the `checkpoints/` directory:

```bash
# Index-TTS
modelscope download --model kusuriuri/Index-TTS-vLLM --local_dir ./checkpoints/Index-TTS-vLLM

# IndexTTS-1.5
modelscope download --model kusuriuri/Index-TTS-1.5-vLLM --local_dir ./checkpoints/Index-TTS-1.5-vLLM

# IndexTTS-2
modelscope download --model kusuriuri/IndexTTS-2-vLLM --local_dir ./checkpoints/IndexTTS-2-vLLM
```

#### Manual Download

- ModelScope: [Index-TTS](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/kusuriuri/Index-TTS-vLLM) | [IndexTTS-1.5](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/kusuriuri/Index-TTS-1.5-vLLM) | [IndexTTS-2](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/kusuriuri/IndexTTS-2-vLLM)

#### Convert original weights yourself (Optional, not recommended)

You can use `convert_hf_format.sh` to convert the official weight files yourself:

```bash
bash convert_hf_format.sh /path/to/your/model_dir
```

### 6. Launch the web UI!

Run the corresponding version (the first launch may take longer due to CUDA kernel compilation for bigvgan):

```bash
# Index-TTS 1.0
python webui.py

# IndexTTS-1.5
python webui.py --version 1.5

# IndexTTS-2
python webui_v2.py
```


## API

An API interface is encapsulated using FastAPI. Here is an example of how to start it:

```bash
# Index-TTS-1.0/1.5
python api_server.py

# IndexTTS-2
python api_server_v2.py
```

### Startup Parameters
- `--model_dir`: Required, path to the model weights.
- `--host`: Server IP address, defaults to `0.0.0.0`.
- `--port`: Server port, defaults to `6006`.
- `--gpu_memory_utilization`: vllm GPU memory utilization rate, defaults to `0.25`.

### API Request Examples
- For v1/1.5, please refer to `api_example.py`.
- For v2, please refer to `api_example_v2.py`.

### OpenAI API
- Added `/audio/speech` API path for compatibility with the OpenAI interface.
- Added `/audio/voices` API path to get the list of voices/characters.

For details, see: [createSpeech](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createSpeech)

## New Features
- **v1/v1.5:** Supports multi-character audio mixing: You can input multiple reference audios, and the TTS output voice will be a mix of these reference audios. (Inputting multiple reference audios may lead to an unstable output voice; you can try multiple times to get a satisfactory voice and then use it as a reference audio).

## Performance
Word Error Rate (WER) Results for IndexTTS and Baseline Models on the [**seed-test**](https://github.com/BytedanceSpeech/seed-tts-eval)

## Concurrency Test
Refer to [`simple_test.py`](simple_test.py). The API service must be started first.
